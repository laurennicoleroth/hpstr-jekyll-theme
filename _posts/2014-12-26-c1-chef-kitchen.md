Watch Shereef's Fireside Chat. This chat is over an hour long, so watch the parts you're interested in and make sure to leave time for writing your blog!

Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

Talk about what came up for you and anything you want in addition to the questions above.
